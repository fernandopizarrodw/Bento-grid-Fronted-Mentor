## 🧠 What I Learned  
This project was a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with **CSS Grid**. I practiced building a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes using **media queries** and **grid areas**.

## ⚙️ Built With  
- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- CSS Grid  
- Media Queries  
- Mobile-first workflow  

## 🔧 Challenge  
One of the main challenges was resizing the inner content of each grid box when switching from mobile to desktop layout. It helped me better understand how grid tracks and items adapt across breakpoints.
